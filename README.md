# Phishing Detection Project

## Overview

This project is a web application designed to detect phishing websites. It is built using Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, Flask for the machine learning model serving, and Scikit-learn for the machine learning model itself.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Developed with Angular to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input URLs and receive phishing detection results.
- **Backend**: Implemented with Spring Boot to handle API requests from the frontend and communicate with the Flask server.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Created using Scikit-learn, served through a Flask API, to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate.
- **Integration**: The backend sends URLs to the Flask server for prediction and returns the results to the frontend.
